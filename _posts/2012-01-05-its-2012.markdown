Where's my flying car?

Seriously, though, I haven't had much time to do much with emacs over the holidays, other than use it at work. We're still working on zf-mode, and I've improved my emacs-setup package a bit (not sure if I've ever mentioned that on this blog before, but its another emacs package I wrote).

Basically, long story short, emacs still rocks.
