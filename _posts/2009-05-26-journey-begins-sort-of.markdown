Welcome to my new blog: Emacs Journey! I'd like to take some time at first to explain what this blog is and will be. (If you care, my personal blog is [here](http://bzwahr.blogspot.com/).)
<!--more-->
In the past couple of years, I have become an avid user of Emacs. I use it mostly at work to code PHP, check mail, instant message, browse the web, and be productive in a number of other ways. One thing I've learned about Emacs is that there is always something new to learn and try. These days, I spend more time on [EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org) than I do on [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), finding new modes, functions, and packages to try out in Emacs.

What this has lead me to believe is that Emacs is a journey, at least for me. I'm constantly updating my .emacs file and trying out different modes and .el files, and I never cease to be amazed at just how versatile Emacs can be (even the default emacs: check out [artist-mode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode)!).

However, I have a terrible memory, so I have decided to start this blog to record my experiences with Emacs for future reference. I invite anyone and everyone to read my posts and share them: new packages and elisp files I've tried, functions and macros I've written, modes I'm using (or not), etc. One caveat: I will be posting things as I discover them, so don't be surprised if one week I post how great some new package is, then the next week post about how I had to fix it or stop using it. Like I said, this is a journey, and I am inviting everyone along!

The title of this entry says "sort of". This is just my way of reminding that my emacs journey is not beginning now, just the blog I will use to keep track of it. Better late than never, right?

Finally, here's some generic information about my emacs setup: I run GNU Emacs 22.3.1 on [Gentoo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org).  Any and all information posted on this site will pertain to this version only, as I can't guarantee that anything will work on previous or future versions. If I update versions, or have something to say about any other emacs version, I will make sure to clarify it.

So, off we go into the wild GNU yonder...
