Anyone who knows me knows I really enjoy Lisp, especially Common Lisp (sbcl) and elisp (Emacs). I can now add to that list [Clojure](http://clojure.org).
<!--more-->

Clojure is awesome. It's a Lisp language that runs in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Lisp + Java. Who'd have ever thought...

Certainly not me, but the end result is an excellent language. It has some differences from the Lisps I'm used to, like argument lists being vectors instead of lists and docstrings going before argument lists. However, these habits were easy enough to break, and were never a hindrance enough to bog me down.

So off I went, writing my first Clojure program, which can be find [here](https://github.com/echosa/clojure-greed). I plan to continue working on it and improving it, and will be looking for some code reviews from more experience Clojure developers.
