This is just a bit of shameless self-promotion. I've started a Twitter account called [@EmacsHaiku](http://twitter.com/emacshaiku). It is exactly what it sounds like: haikus about Emacs! I've already had others submit their own, too!

I think this is going to be a lot of fun and will become even more fun as more people join in with their own!
