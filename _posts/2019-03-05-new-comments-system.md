As I mentioned in my previous post I wrote about the new site theme and layout, I have now switched the comment system here from Disqus to [Staticman](https://staticman.net/)! Right now, all the previous Disqus comments are not available. However, I eventually plan on manually adding them all here Staticman comments instead. Until that happens, though, only new comments will appear. Note that comments require approval before appearing on the page.

Happy commenting!
