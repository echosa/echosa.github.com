Well, I've decided to start using emacs via the terminal again, for a few reasons.
<!--more-->
1.) Performance

Keeping in mind I run Mac OS X and use the emacs from MacPorts, the terminal emacs loads much quicker than Emacs.app.

2.) Portability

I've recently begun using tmux (like screen, but in my opinion better). I can run my emacs inside tmux at work, then if I need to do some work remotely, I can just ssh into my work computer and reattach the tmux session to continue my work. At least, that's the theory. Haven't actually done this yet.

3.) Because I Want To

Really, I just felt like getting back to a terminal work style, partially for reason numbers 1 and 2 above, and partially just to do it because I can.

I've had a couple of hiccups here and there, and I've definitely had to relearn and unlearn habits (its amazing how much I use the mouse, even though I consider myself a mostly keyboard kinda guy). So far, though, just about everything seems to be working.
