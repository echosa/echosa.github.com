So, in my pursuits to get my emacs packages into MELPA, I learned about checkdoc. In a word, checkdoc is *awesome*, and essential (in my opinion) to any emacs/elisp developer.

What is checkdoc, you ask? It's actually what it sounds like. It checks your elisp for proper documentation. Better yet, it interactively helps you fix, correct, or add the necessary changes!

If you have any elisp files or packages you maintain, I highly recommend opening them and running M-x checkdoc. Even if you don't change or fix anything, you'll have a much better idea as to the type of documentation that is expected when writing packages.

Seriously, go do it now. You'll thank me later.
