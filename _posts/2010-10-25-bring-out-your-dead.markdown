I'm not dead. Honest.

I've just been really busy with a lot of things. I hadn't posted here in a while, so I thought I'd at least let you all know that I haven't stopped. In fact, I been spending a lot of time working on a new suite for emacs that makes it a lot better for programming in PHP, especially (but not necessarily) if you use the Zend Framework.

I've still got some tweaks and testing to do, but I'm really excited about this. Trust me, when I have something I feel comfortable releasing, I will post about it here.

Until then, sorry for the lack of posts or updates.
