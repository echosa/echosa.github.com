All good things must come to an end.
<!--more-->
I'll be honest with you all. I really enjoyed using Acme, but the required mouse is too inconvenient. When I grab my laptop to do some coding in bed, I don't want to also have to grab a mouse, some sort of flat surface, possibly a mouse pad, and then position everything just right.

Acme has a lot going for it. I learned new ways to think about text editing that will stick with me through the years. I still find myself thinking in terms of the way Acme does things every now and then, but I just can't justify the inconvenience of the mouse. This has nothing to do with whether using the keyboard is better/faster/more l337/etc. than using a mouse. It's sheer physical convenience.

We had some good times. We laughed. We cried. We learned a lot. I hope you all enjoyed reading these posts and that y'all learned as much from them as I learned from the experiment and all the comments.

I'll end with a big thank you to all who commented on my blog posts or responded to my questions on Twitter. Your information was invaluable to the experience.
