I recently released [Emacsagist](https://github.com/echosa/emacsagist), an Emacs front-end for searching [Packagist](http://packagist.org).
<!--more-->
You can download Emacsagist via the [MELPA repository](http://melpa.milkbox.net/) with `M-x list-packages` or [Cask](http://cask.github.io). From there, you can run `M-x emacsagist-search`, type in a search term, and Emacsagist will give you search results. You can press return on any package name to get full details.

Now there's one less reason to leave Emacs for PHP developers.
