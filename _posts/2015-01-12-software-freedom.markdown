Over on my personal blog, I posted [an article](http://echosa.freeshell.org/phlog/0014-software-freedom) concerning software freedom.

The post was the product of a few days of thinking and consideration after watching a presentation by Richard Stallman concerning freedom and free (as in liberty) software. There's a link to the video in the blog post, as well.

I don't usually cross-post blogs like this, but in this case the information is both personal and developer-oriented in nature. Therefore, I decided to mention it here as well. It is an important topic which deserves discussion.
