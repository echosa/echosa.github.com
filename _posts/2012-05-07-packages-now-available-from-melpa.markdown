That's right, I've submitted three of the packages I've written (zf-mode, mysql2sqlite, and emacs-setup) to the MELPA repository for package.el and they have been added. This makes installed them easier for you! Now you can simply `M-x package-list-packages` then search for whichever packaged you'd like to install, then press i (mark for installation) followed by x (execute marked actions). Easy!
