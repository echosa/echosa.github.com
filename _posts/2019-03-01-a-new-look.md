As mentioned in the last post, I was looking for a new theme for this blog. Well, I found it! I'm now using the awesome [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/) theme for Jekyll. It looks great. It's easy to configure. I highly recommend it! Hopefully you like it as much as I do!

I'm still looking into replacing Disqus for comments, but I haven't quite gotten there yet. I'm currently looking into [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), which seems super cool and exactly what I want. I'll be trying to switch away from Disqus soon. My hope is that I'll be able to import or convert all existing comments. If not, however, I'm sorry for losing the existing comments. 

So, now that I've got the blog configured, revamped, and lookin' good, I can start focusing on posting content again! I've got an idea or two for upcoming posts/series, so stay tuned! I think you'll enjoy it.
