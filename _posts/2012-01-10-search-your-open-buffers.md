I've been using emacs for *years*, and it still amazes me how many features that I would consider "basic" I'm still learning about even now. For a while I've always thought it would be handy to search my open buffers. However, since I'm typically programming, most of the buffers I want to search are tied to files, so in the past I've just made sure all my buffers are saved and used with rgrep or find-grep-dired.

Now, I know there's a way to do what I originally wanted. Using multi-occur or multi-occur-in-matching-buffers you can search your open buffers for a regular expressing, and limit the searched buffers by regular expressing using the latter. I foresee this being very handy, and thought I'd share.
