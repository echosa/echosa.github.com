So, [this](http://gopherpedia.com) exists.
<!--more-->
That's right. Someone wrote a Gopher wrapper/front end for Wikipedia! It's not quite perfect (links and stuff don't work) but it's Good EnoughÂ©.

The link above takes you to the web front end, but you can reach it the site through Gopher itself at gopher://gopherpedia.com.

Long live Gopher!
