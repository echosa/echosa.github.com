It's been a long, long time since I did anything with this blog. I think it's time to bring it back!

First and foremost, you'll notice a new look. I've moved away from using [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and am now just using straight [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). For now, I'm using the default theme, [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). I'll be keeping my eye out for a more full-featured theme in the future (specifically looking for one that handles tags). I'm open to suggestions!

Now, what about content? Well, for the most part, the content will be the same: programming, software, etc. I've got a couple of new ideas and series' in the works, though, so stay tuned!

I'm still getting used to the new site myself, so you might see it change in the near future as I poke, prod, and tweak it. Either way, it's good to be back, and I hope everyone enjoys the posts to come!
