Remember [Gopher][1]? I do, barely. We learned/used it in grade school a couple of decades ago. Turns out it is still around.

There are several resources for the existing gopher community. First and foremost, I'd say check out [Floodgap](http://gopher.floodgap.com). They have a public gopher server, including a web interface that will let you read gopher pages in your browser. There's even several articles about [gopher's usage and relevance today](http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher://gopher.floodgap.com:70/1/gopher). Definitely worth at least a cursory glance.

Of course, having found this, I had to jump back in. You can find my own gopherspace hosted [here](gopher://sdf.org/1/users/echosa) at [SDF](http://sdf.org). There you find, among other things, my phlog, which is gopher's version of a blog (blog = weB LOG, phlog = goPHer LOG).

Anyway, I figured I'd just help spread the word. Long live gopher!
