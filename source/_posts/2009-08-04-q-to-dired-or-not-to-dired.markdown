Ok, emacs community, it's Q&A time. I ask the question, and you answer!
<!--more-->
Q: It seems everywhere I look, I keep seeing people discussing dired: irc, forums, blogs, etc. I don't use dired, as I don't really see its purpose when I have a perfectly good terminal (both inside and outside of emacs). Do you use dired? If so/not, why/why not? Looking for insight here folks.

Keep in mind, I'm not looking to be swayed one way or the other, so please don't try. I just want to know what other people think of dired, how they find it useful (or not), how they use it to GTD, etc. Opinions, examples, anecdotes, references, etc. are all welcome.
