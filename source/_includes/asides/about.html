  <h1>About Me</h1>
  I have been programming since I learned BASIC back in grade school. I currently work for <a href="http://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a> as a PHP developer. I enjoy Lisps, especially Clojure, and prefer to use text editors such as acme, sam, emacs, and vim. I like dragons, and collect them. Tea is ambrosia.
