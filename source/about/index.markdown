I am many things: husband, PHP developer, Emacs user, occasional vim user, dragon collector, fisherman, gamer, musician, human. I graduated from the University of Phoenix in 2008 with a Bachelor's in Information Technology, and haven't stopped learning since. My favorite "work" to do is writing modes and extensions to Emacs, but for a living I mostly write web applications in PHP and Java. I'm co-host of and an occasional speaker at the [Bryan/College Station PHP Users Group](http://bcsphp.eventbrite.com/).

In my love of (almost) all things Emacs. I'm also the author of a few Emacs packages, including [php+-mode](https://github.com/echosa/phpplus-mode), [emacs-setup](https://github.com/echosa/emacs-setup), [mysql2sqlite](https://github.com/echosa/emacs-mysql2sqlite) which can all be downloaded and installed via Emacs' package manager through the [MELPA repository](http://melpa.milkbox.net/). I also work on the [Emacs interface](https://github.com/echosa/vimgolf) for [VimGolf](http://www.vimgolf.com/).

In my spare time I listen to a lot of music of various genres, and write and record my own as well. I like watching TV, especially geeky type shows (Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Farscape, Firefly, etc). My wife and I both love to play games: sometimes video games, but mostly table top games (board, card, dice, etc). Examples include Munchkin, Carcassonne, Killer Bunnies, Zombies, Clue, Monopoly (my personal favorite), and chess. I'll rarely turn down a game of horseshoes, darts, or pool (8-ball or 9-ball).
