    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, a friend recently turned me on to <a href="https://turntable.fm">TurnTable.fm</a> which is an awesome place to listen to, discover, and share the music you love. In checking out some of the different rooms, I discovered that some people had written bots that do different things: manage who can play songs, post fun messages, keep stats, etc. Out of curiosity, I decided to try my hand at making a bot.</p>

<p>I quickly found <a href="https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API">an api for working with TurnTable.fm via Node.js</a>. This set me on a path to try out and learn programming with Node.js.</p>

<p>My initial reaction? My God, the callbacks.</p>

<p>Basically everything is asynchronous so when you call a function, if something needs to happen when it&rsquo;s done, that &ldquo;something&rdquo; has to be passed in the form of  a function as an argument. Its definitely a different way of thinking about programming, mostly (for me anyway) because I struggled to find the end points. If I just keep calling callback after callback after callback where will it end? Eventually, and after quite a bit of programming in this way, I began to get a feel for it.</p>

<p>My current reaction? This is awesome.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the experience of programming for Node.js and I&rsquo;d recommend it to others. There are lots of packages, test utilities, and lots of cool stuff written in Node.js, and I can now understand why.</p>

<p>Feel free to checkout my code. It is <a href="https://github.com/echosa/ImproverBot">hosted on GitHub</a>. For now, I&rsquo;m pretty much done working on it, but I may revisit it again in the future. Either way, it was a great learning experience that I very much enjoyed.</p>
