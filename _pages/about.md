I have been programming since I learned BASIC back in grade school on an Apple ][e. I currently work for <a href="http://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a> as a PHP developer, though I also enjoy Lisps, especially Clojure, and most programming languages, really. I also enjoy using text editors such as acme, sam, emacs, vim, and, yes, even ed(1)! (Especially ed(1)!). I like dragons and collect them. Tea is ambrosia.
